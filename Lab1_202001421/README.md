Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

Functonal requirements.

- Access to the Library Information System should be strictly controlled and access should be allowed only after signing in with valid acccount.

- Resources of the library should be properly quantized and single resource should not be allocated to multiple users.

- Status of resources should be properly maintained (Ex. a book is available/issused etc).

- The librarian should have all the privilages to allot, remove and add resources.

- Non-members should be freely able to browse booka but issuing and return of books should be restricted to valid users.

- Web application for the software should be made in HTML5.

- Users should be able to access the application through various devices, OSs and browsers.

Non-Functional requirements.

- The application should run smoothly on the institute LAN.

- All passwords and confidential information should be encrypted and access should be given only after providing valid keys.

- A scalable database should be used in back-end so that it would be able to handle a large collection of books and requests.

- Database should be consisitent and reject in-consistent queries.

- The user interface should be easy to use.

- The system should be available 24x7 and down-time should be minimized.

Q.2

Scope: It is an AI enabled tool that helps people suffering from hearing problems to be aware about sounds in their surroundings. The application is made such that it has a very simple yet elegant UI to ensure that the user has a seamless experience. It is made with the purpose of giving physically challenged people maximum awareness of their surroundings.

Features:

- It is a super-fast and light app that gives lightning fast notifications of surrounding sounds.

- It also has intelligent features that are able to classify sounds and alert the users based on their severity.

- It is extremly power efficient thus ensuring user can use it for prolonged preiod of time.

- Feedback time for the system should be minimized and should not cross a certain threshold.

Non-Functional Aspects:

- It is highly scalable thereby ensuring maximum number of people to use it simultaneously.

- As the user is always supposed to continously run the software to capture surrounding sounds different modes should be given to filter out private conversations.

- Alerts should be prioritized based on severity.

- The algorithm should be able to continously learn from past mistakes.
